## Description
This project was part of the subject "Data Structures and Algorithms" where I was asked to implement most of the data structures and search algorithms in order to prove my understanding of the topics I have seen through my third semester. 

## Main Learnings 
* Queue
* Stack
* Lists (Simple Linked, Double Linked)
* Search Algorithms (DFS, BFS)
* Sort Algorithms (QuickSort, BubbleSort, SelectionSort, MergeSort)
* Graphs
* Binary Search Tree (BST)

## Installation
* Make sure to have installed a C++ enviroment 
* Download the repository on your local machine
* Run the command <code>./main</code> on the terminal located at the root path of the project or just open the <code>main.exe</code> file
